　　不知道现实中公安局长把全体警察全调出来查一个罪犯是为公呢，还是为私？唯一的解释，要么这个公安局长是个白痴，要么这个公安局长借口查案，使用调虎离山之计，以便他的亲信在全城的警察去某地“抓罪犯”的同时，可以无忧无虑地从容实施强奸行为。
有一种爱，挂着泪珠，但很凄美，它叫放弃！放弃虽然痛苦，但也是一种幸福拥有，感情是不能勉强的，如果死死抓住，抓住的也是伤痕和痛苦。把手握紧，里面什么也没有，把手松开，拥有...【阅读全文】
夜色让人想起无法遗忘的痛苦，没有人能屏蔽痛苦，我承受着被强行抽离的痛苦，他拥抱着美好和纯真，而他也替我做着不再提及的美梦。因为我还有拥有天真，往事凋零他把心结放在佛的手心上，让我相信世间一切善良都是美好的希望。
My right hand patted her shoulder and said, yes, children, father is sometimes thought that people live for the sake of what?
Where is the meaning of it?
I like you so much, to live in the mountains, but have no you.
At that time, I always afraid of the night, afraid of parents don't come back, afraid of the beast: eat myself.
These fears, however, in the spring, the leaves blue season, had disappeared.
Do you want to know why?
"You see under the horseshoe/running hastily spring/around the yard/extension of the evening light/it dusty dark shadow/let all my life I have live in once upon a time" (" the shadow "), such poetry reminds us that life and stay in the poet's inner life, is the skirt of the dim light.
It suggests that Wang Rebing in the hardships of life, the fate of the bumpy, implicit spending, not to lament and fear before life variables, only forever of devotion and gratitude.
It was tolerance and gratitude of the suffering that the poet with a lingering shadow and pain continue to hit the road.
In Wang Rebing, with light, spring, flowers, love for image works, often is very extensive, appear very vivid and rich rhythm.
The results of these images taken the mutually melt, if ice spirit of poetry space appear quiescence and broad, there is a stirring power and the warm like spring.
With its misty poetry style, created the beginning of vernacular poetry rational subjects, from the language and structure, to many of the things worth thinking about.
If the ice point of view, the meaning of the poem is: "poets poetry is just a way of life, the poet's personality power than anything to keep for a long time.
By reading the works if ice, I believe that no rules of art, as long as let nature take its course, is a good poem.
In my opinion, romantic is the nature of the poet, but excessive pursuing aestheticism but affect the extension of artistic conception.
Writing poetry is not written news and commentary, want to hold good for restraint of express feelings, pay attention to that day is not only mild pain, originally beautiful things will be more beautiful.
Like tianshui teachers college Ding Nian Mr. Bao in if ice poetry review "feeling the pain of life in the lyric" write, how to make the poem in such writings but beauty, has more kind of earthly fireworks flavor and texture of life, to get as much as possible the audience, I'm afraid Wang Rebing should ponder.
I think if ice and innovation, through the efforts of life must have its poetry is able to move towards the world, it also use a question?
Listen and rendering, honestly if ice is not a poetic "prostitutes" in the collection of "listening and present poets, writers is the river culture in the long river in the Yellow River is a spray.
For Wang Rebing tianshui on behalf of the literary world of poetry, a young group of poem has its own personality, in the literary world has experienced in gansu from once to defeat them, stumbling walk revitalize literary career path.
As I have the essays, inside a strange artist name and I want to say, are unknown tianshui the literary arts workers.
See clearly from their work, it seems, is the most fruitful results, tianshui, gansu province and even the whole poetry which containing more over the past few decades LongYuan literature and art of the vicissitudes of life and suffering.
According to a report in "warm" such as the third jili, visible is active in tianshui city of more than 20 friends, have a foothold home, pay close attention to life, use the age and the life song.
Changhe poetry, and poetry.
Colour the burden, but the beauty of poem.
Like business is full of spring, with its colorful, with its gorgeous show a lush and rich poetry entity and the western culture.
